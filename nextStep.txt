Next steps (TwinCAT + app)

1) Set environment variables
   - Copy .env.example to server/.env
   - Update AMS_NET_ID, ADS_HOST, ADS_PORT (851 for Runtime 1 is typical)

2) TwinCAT setup (on the PLC/target PC)
   - Open your TwinCAT project in XAE.
   - Ensure the PLC has the GVL_UI struct symbols (Cmd, Telemetry).
   - In the PLC project properties, enable "Generate Symbol File".
   - Activate configuration and put the PLC in Run.

3) ADS routing (same PC or remote)
   - In TwinCAT XAE, open System > Routes.
   - Add a route from your dev PC to the target (enter target AMS Net ID and IP).
   - If the PLC is remote, also add a route from the target back to your dev PC.
   - Confirm the target is reachable (green or "Connected" in TwinCAT).

4) Run both UI + server
   - From repo root: npm install
   - Then: npm run setup
   - Then: npm start
   - UI: http://localhost:3001 (server: http://localhost:3002)

If you still cannot connect:
   - Verify AMS_NET_ID matches the target runtime (TwinCAT icon > About > AMS Net ID).
   - Check Windows firewall allows ADS router port 48898.
   - Confirm the PLC runtime is started and "Run" is visible in TwinCAT.
